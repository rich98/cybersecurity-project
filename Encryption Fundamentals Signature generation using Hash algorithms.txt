Using the following algorithms, generate a valid signature for the message 2.

Hash function: (x+3) mod 10

Encryption: RSA with the following parameters

Private key: 11

Public key: 5

Modulus: 14

Hashing the message: We use the provided hash function (x+3) mod 10. Substituting x with 2 (our message), we get (2+3) mod 10 = 5 mod 10 = 5. So, the hash of the message 2 is 5.

Encrypting the hash: We use RSA encryption with the provided private key and modulus. The encryption formula for RSA is c = m^e mod n, where m is the message (or hash in our case), e is the key, and n is the modulus. Substituting m with 5 (our hash), e with 11 (our private key), and n with 14 (our modulus), we get c = 5^11 mod 14.

Calculating 5^11 mod 14 calculating the powers of 5 modulo 14 until we find a pattern. Hereâ€™s how:

5^1 mod 14 = 5
5^2 mod 14 = 11
5^3 mod 14 = 13
5^4 mod 14 = 9
5^5 mod 14 = 11
5^6 mod 14 = 13
5^7 mod 14 = 9

We can see that starting from 5^3, the result cycles every two powers. Since 11 is odd, 5^11 mod 14 will have the same result as 5^3 mod 14, which is 13.

So, the RSA encryption of the hash 5 with the private key 11 and modulus 14 is 13.

Therefore, the signature for the message 2 is 13. This signature is what you would send along with your message to ensure its authenticity. The receiver can then decrypt the signature using your public key to verify the hash and, consequently, the integrity of the message.
