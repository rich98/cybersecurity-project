Using the following algorithms, generate a valid signature for the message 2.

Hash function: (x+3) mod 10

Encryption: RSA with the following parameters

Private key: 11

Public key: 5

Modulus: 14
Hash the message: We use the provided hash function (x+3) mod 10 to hash the message 2. So, the hash of the message is (2+3) mod 10 = 5.

Encrypt the hash: We then use RSA encryption with the provided private key 11 and modulus 14 to encrypt the hash. The encryption formula for RSA is c = m^e mod n, where m is the message (or in this case, the hash), e is the key, and n is the modulus. So, the encrypted hash (i.e., the signature) is 5^11 mod 14.

(5 ** 11) % 14 calculates the remainder when 5 raised to the power of 11 is divided by 14.

In Python, the ** operator is used for exponentiation and the % operator is used for modulus.

The result of (5 ** 11) % 14 is 9.


Python

# Python code to calculate the signature
m = 5  # hash of the message
e = 11  # private key
n = 14  # modulus

signature = (m ** e) % n
print(signature)
