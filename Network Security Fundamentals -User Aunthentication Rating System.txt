Part one: Considering what you ve learned through the course, how would you describe the process of User Authentication 
on a web site by having three different factors of authentication? Answers to this should include information about the different factors (
Knowledge, Ownership, Inherence) and their examples, and also the whole process, for example, “user will show his face to the 
camera after entering the password and pin from the token”. 


Part One Answer: 
User Authentication on a Website with Three-Factor Authentication
User authentication is a crucial aspect of web security, and employing three different factors enhances the overall protection. These factors are:
1.	Knowledge Factor:
•	Example: Users enter a password known only to them.
•	Process: The user provides a unique password during login.
2.	Ownership Factor:
•	Example: Users possess a physical device like a security token or smartphone.
•	Process: After entering the password, the user interacts with a token or app generating a one-time code.
3.	Inherence Factor:
•	Example: Biometric data such as fingerprints or facial recognition.
•	Process: Following password and ownership verification, the user undergoes a biometric scan, like a facial recognition check.
In summary, a user accessing a website employing three-factor authentication would first enter a password. Subsequently, they interact with a physical device for ownership confirmation, and finally, undergo a biometric scan to establish inherence.

Part two: Describe, at least four, attack vectors on a company that produces shoes, 
both Physical and Digital. Answers to this should include information about what can be attacked and how, for example, 
“considering that the company produces shoes, they need to, somehow, receive money from the buyers/distributors, 
and an attack vector can be the payment processor of the company”

Part Two Answer: 
Attack Vectors on a Shoe Company (Physical and Digital)
1.	Digital Attack Vectors:
•	Payment Processor Compromise: Attackers target the company's payment processing system to gain unauthorized access to financial transactions.
•	Supply Chain Cyber-Attack: Malicious actors compromise the digital systems managing the supply chain, potentially introducing malware into the production process.
•	Intellectual Property Theft: Cybercriminals may attempt to steal design blueprints, patents, or other intellectual property related to the company's shoe designs.
•	Phishing Attacks on Employees: Attackers send deceptive emails to company employees, aiming to gain unauthorized access or extract sensitive information.
2.	Physical Attack Vectors:
•	Warehouse Theft: Criminals physically break into the company's warehouses to steal finished shoe products.
•	Transportation Hijacking: Attackers intercept and hijack shipments during transportation, leading to theft of shoes in transit.
•	Point-of-Sale Tampering: Criminals may physically tamper with the company's retail point-of-sale systems to compromise customer payment information.
•	Corporate Espionage: Competitors or malicious actors physically infiltrate the company's offices to gather proprietary information.

Part three: Considering the wireless security, describe in your own words what Krack Attack is. 
(hard one) Answers to this should reference “key reinstallation attacks” in some way, for example, “Krack attack is an attack on key reinstallation”. 

Part Three Answer: 
Krack Attack in Wireless Security
The Krack Attack, short for "Key Reinstallation Attack," is a vulnerability in the WPA2 protocol, a widely used standard for securing Wi-Fi networks. 
In simple terms, it exploits the process of reinstalling an already-in-use encryption key during a four-way handshake.
During a standard WPA2 handshake, an attacker can intercept and manipulate the key exchange process, forcing the reuse of a cryptographic key. 
This allows them to decrypt and potentially manipulate the transmitted data. Essentially, Krack Attack exposes a flaw in the WPA2 protocol, making Wi-Fi networks susceptible to unauthorized access and data interception.


Part four: Considering what you’ve learned through the course, describe what machines should AntiVirus and Firewalls be installed in a 
network where you have 10 servers and 10 client machines, where all of them have internet and process information provided by outsiders of the company. 
Answers to this should be at least “all of them” as the whole company should be protected by both solutions.

Part Four Answer:
Placement of AntiVirus and Firewalls in a Network
In a network with 10 servers and 10 client machines, where all devices have internet access and process information from external sources, 
both AntiVirus and Firewalls should be installed on all machines. This includes servers and client machines alike. Comprehensive protection 
is crucial to safeguard the entire network from potential threats originating from external sources. By deploying AntiVirus software and Firewalls 
on all machines, the company can establish a robust defense mechanism against malware, unauthorized access, and other security risks, ensuring 
the security of both client and server-side components.
